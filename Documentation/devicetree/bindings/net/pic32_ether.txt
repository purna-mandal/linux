* PIC32 Ethernet Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "microchip,pic32-ether"
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts: Should contain ethernet interrupt
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- clock-names: Single clock names.
	Required elements: 'eth_clk'
- clocks: Phandle to clock.

Examples:

	pic32_ether: ethernet@bf882000 {
		compatible = "microchip,pic32-ether";
		reg = <0xbf882000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <ETHERNET_INTERRUPT DEFAULT_INT_PRI IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		phy-mode = "rmii";
		mac-address = [00 00 00 00 00 00];
		clock-names = "eth_clk";
		clocks = <&PBCLK5>;
	};
