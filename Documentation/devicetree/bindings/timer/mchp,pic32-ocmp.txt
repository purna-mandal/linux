Microchip PIC32 output-compare

The PIC32 output-compare(OC) module can generate single pulse or train of pulses
in response to selected time bases and operating mode. This module is capable of
triggering ADC or asserting interrupt and working as PWM controller.

Required properties:
- compatible : should be "mchp,pic32-ocmp".
- reg : Specifies base address and size of the registers.
- interrupts : See evic ../interrupt-controller/.
- oc-id: module id (starting at 1) as documented in FRM.

Optional properties:
- mchp,oc-32bit : added only when 32bit timebase is used.
- mchp,oc-adc : OC can trigger an ADC.
- mchp,oc-pwm: OC as PWM controller.

Example:

ocmp1: {
	#oc-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "mchp,pic32-ocmp";
	reg = <0xbf844000 0x30>;
	interrupts = <0>;
	oc-id = <1>;
	mchp,oc-32bit; /* class B, 32-bit combined timer; usable for ADC */
	mchp,oc-pwm; /* PWM controller */
};

The output-compare consumers should specify the desire OC by having in its
"pic32,ocmp" phandle cell. For example for PWM

pwm-0: {
	compatible = <>;
	mchp,ocmp = <&ocmp1>; /* ocmp phandle */
};
